The protein_info service returns certain protein annotations about
fids, such as domain assignments, operons, and orthologs.  (These
include annotations currently found in MicrobesOnline but are not
yet in KBase.)

We currently have a draft specification file and some methods
partially working:

fids_to_operons returns a poor structure (references locusIds still, not
	organized by genome)
fids_to_domains returns HMM domains for a fid (no COG or FastBLAST yet)
domains_to_fids accepts HMM domains only (no COG or FastBLAST yet)

Error handling is poor at the moment.

The next release should have a first draft of working code for
all the methods of the protein_info service.

Future releases should try to add more methods, and begin to
author the ER model to include the data types directly in KBase.
