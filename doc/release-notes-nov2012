The protein_info service returns certain protein annotations about
fids, such as domain assignments, operons, and orthologs.  (These
include annotations currently found in MicrobesOnline but are not
yet in KBase.)

We currently have a draft specification file, but no working code.

The next release should have a first draft of working code for
the protein_info service.

Future releases should try to add more methods, and begin to
author the ER model to include the data types directly in KBase.
