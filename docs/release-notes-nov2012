The protein_info service returns certain protein annotations about
fids, such as domain assignments, operons, and orthologs.  (These
include annotations currently found in MicrobesOnline but are not
yet in KBase.)

We currently have a draft specification file and a working
implementation of all methods.  There are still some known
bugs and missing features.

fids_to_operons may return an operon from a different version
	of the genome instead of the exact genome
fids_to_operons also currently returns multiple copies of the
	same fid for some input fids
fids_to_domains returns HMM domains or COG assignments for a fid
	(no FastBLAST yet)
domains_to_fids accepts HMM domains or COGs only (no FastBLAST yet)
fids_to_orthologs uses a CGI stub at MicrobesOnline to retrieve
	orthologs for MicrobesOnline locusIds (the SQL to retrieve
	these annotations is too complicated to port to KBase)
fids_to_ecs fails to return any results if one bad fid is given

Error handling is poor or nonexistent at the moment, and no
test suite exists.

The next release should have better tests and error handling,
and should have better defined behavior when dealing with non-
proteins.

Future releases should try to add more methods, add scripts suitable
for use in IRIS, and begin to author the ER model to include the data
types directly in KBase.
