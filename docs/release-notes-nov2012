The protein_info service returns certain protein annotations about
fids, such as domain assignments, operons, and orthologs.  (These
include annotations currently found in MicrobesOnline but are not
yet in KBase.)

We currently have a draft specification file and a working
implementation of all methods.  There are still some known
bugs and missing features.

The database connection sometimes disappears, and methods do not
return a reasonable error to this effect.

fids_to_operons may return an operon from a different version
	of the genome instead of the exact genome
fids_to_domains returns HMM domains or COG assignments for a fid
	(no FastBLAST yet)
domains_to_fids accepts any domain_id, even invalid ones
domains_to_fids searches for HMM domains or COGs only (no FastBLAST yet)
fids_to_orthologs uses a CGI stub at MicrobesOnline to retrieve
	orthologs for MicrobesOnline locusIds (the SQL to retrieve
	these annotations is too complicated to port to KBase)

Error handling is poor or nonexistent at the moment.

The next release should have better error handling, and should have 
better defined behavior when dealing with non-proteins or invalid
identifiers as input.

Future releases should try to add more methods, add scripts suitable
for use in IRIS, and begin to author the ER model to include the data
types directly in KBase.  More metadata should be returned about the
return values as well (for example, coordinates of a domain hit to
the protein, the text description of the domain_id).
