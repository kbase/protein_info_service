The protein_info service returns certain protein annotations about
fids, such as domain assignments, operons, and orthologs.  (These
include annotations currently found in MicrobesOnline but are not
yet in KBase.)

We currently have a draft specification file and some methods
partially working:

fids_to_operons may return an operon from a different version
	of the genome instead of the exact genome
fids_to_domains returns HMM domains or COG assignments for a fid
	(no FastBLAST yet)
domains_to_fids accepts HMM domains or COGs only (no FastBLAST yet)

The other methods are not yet implemented.

Error handling is poor or nonexistent at the moment, and no
test suite exists.

The next release should have a first draft of working code for
all the methods of the protein_info service, as well as basic test
scripts.

Future releases should try to add more methods, and begin to
author the ER model to include the data types directly in KBase.
